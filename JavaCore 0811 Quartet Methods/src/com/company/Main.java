0811 Quartet Methods

Implement 4 methods.
Each of them should return a list that is best suited for performing these operations (it will cope with a large number of operations most quickly).
Nothing to measure.
Requirements:
1. The program should not display text on the screen.
2. The Solution class should contain only 5 methods.
3. The getListForGet method should return the list that is best suited for the pick operation.
4. The getListForSet method should return the list that is best for setting the value of an element.
5. The getListForAddOrInsert method should return the list that is best for adding or inserting an item.
6. The getListForRemove method should return the list that is best suited for the delete operation of an element.
